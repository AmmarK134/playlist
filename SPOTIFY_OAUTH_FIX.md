# üîß Spotify OAuth Callback Issues - FIXED!

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **Session Access Token Mismatch** - Fixed property name inconsistency
2. **Missing Spotify Scopes** - Added required scopes for playlist access
3. **API Route Token Handling** - Updated all routes to handle both token formats

## üéØ **What You Need to Check:**

### **1. Spotify App Redirect URIs**

Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and make sure your app has BOTH redirect URIs:

```
# For Development
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify

# For Production (replace with your actual Vercel URL)
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/spotify
```

### **2. Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set correctly in both `.env.local` and Vercel:

```bash
# Development (.env.local)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Production (Vercel)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

### **3. Spotify App Settings**

In your Spotify app settings, make sure:

1. **App Name**: Something descriptive
2. **App Description**: Brief description
3. **Website**: Your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
4. **Redirect URIs**: Both localhost and production URLs
5. **Scopes**: The app will request these automatically

## üöÄ **Updated Scopes (Now Included):**

The app now requests these scopes:
- `user-read-email` - Read user's email
- `user-read-private` - Read user's private info
- `user-top-read` - Read user's top artists/tracks
- `user-read-recently-played` - Read recently played tracks
- `playlist-read-private` - Read user's private playlists
- `playlist-read-public` - Read public playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` - Create/modify private playlists
- `playlist-modify-public` - Create/modify public playlists

## üîç **Testing Steps:**

1. **Clear Browser Data**: Clear cookies and local storage
2. **Test Development**: `npm run dev` and try logging in
3. **Test Production**: Deploy and test on Vercel
4. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages in browser console
5. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed API calls

## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **"Callback Error"**
- Check redirect URIs match exactly
- Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### **"Not Authenticated" Error**
- Check that all environment variables are set
- Verify Spotify app settings
- Check browser console for errors

### **"No Playlists Showing"**
- The scopes have been updated to include playlist access
- Try logging out and back in to refresh permissions
- Check that the user has playlists in their Spotify account

## ‚úÖ **What's Fixed:**

- ‚úÖ Session token handling (both `accessToken` and `access_token`)
- ‚úÖ Added missing Spotify scopes for playlist access
- ‚úÖ Updated all API routes to handle tokens correctly
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and debugging

**Your app should now work for all users!** üéâ
